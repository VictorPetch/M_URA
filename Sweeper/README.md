#Autonomous car made with arduino, ultrasound, miniservo and motor DC. Capable of sweeping, identifying and evading objects.
v0.1: It still has some problems with ultrasound. Median filter will be added in the next patch so that the ultrasound doesn't read phantom noises.
It has k-means as clusterization method, and it still needs to be better adjusted to it's principal objective (right now it has 4 clusters and two of them isn't really necessary).
